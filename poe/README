The bulk of this README's information has migrated to the POE manpage.

------------------------------
Compatibility Between Versions
------------------------------

As POE moves closer towards the Common Sense axis, it sometimes
diverges away from the Backwards Compatible axis.  If this version is
being installed over a previous one, please check the Changes file to
see what it might break.  Interface changes usually are documented.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE may be installed through the CPAN shell in the usual CPAN shell
manner.  It typically is:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install POE'

It involves a little more work if you have an older CPAN shell:

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  install POE

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE can also be installed manually.  The latest CPAN version can be
found at <ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or in
a similarl named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.  The most
recent development snapshot, which only rarely contains heinous
showstopper bugs, is available from the author's web site at
<http://www.newts.org/~troc/poe.html>.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as an exercise for
the reader.  To "build" and test it afterwards:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The POE manpage discusses system requirements and compatibility
issues.  You can preview it with:

  perldoc ./POE.pm

There are several sample programs in the samples subdirectory.  The
POE manpage briefly explains them.

  ls -l samples

Finally you can install it:

  make install

-------------------------
Test Results and Coverage
-------------------------

Test results for 0.1010 running FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE with perl 5.6.0,
Event 0.79, and Perl/Tk 800.021:

All tests successful.
Files=18, Tests=294, 763 wallclock secs (249.12 cusr + 23.84 csys = 272.96 CPU)

POE's development after 0.1005 consists of a big push to test
everything.  To further this effort, the author wrote a test coverage
reporting program; then he discovered Devel::Coverage.  Oh well!
Anyway, here's the test coverage summary for version 0.1009.  The numbers
don't match up yet, but this is a general guideline for how well-tested
POE is.

Good luck, and thank you for reading!
