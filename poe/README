ABOUT:

 POE is the Perl Object Environment, a framework for non-forking, non-blocking,
 co-operative multitasking, object-oriented virtual environment.  When
 finished, it should look suspiciously like a cross between a MUD and an
 operating system.

DONE:

 * The event queue, select(2) logic, alarms and signals (Kernel.pm).
 * State machines that run within the Kernel (Session.pm).
 * Templates (Wheel.pm).
 * Basic read/write/framing operations (Wheel.pm, Driver.pm, Filter.pm).
 * Low-level object management, and object invocation as Sessions (Curator.pm).

TO DO:

 * Higher-level object management, including inheritance, security,
   side-effects, and standard interactions.
 * Standard object library.
 * MUD input parser.
 * Sample world.
 * Use real threads, if available.
 * (etc.)

COMPATIBILITY:

 POE has been tested with Perl 5.004_04 (look ma', no threads!), on recent
 versions of Linux, FreeBSD, and OS/2.  It uses some packages that aren't
 included with Perl by default [must document better].

AVAILABILITY:

 The latest version of POE should be available from
 <URL:http://www.netrus.net/users/troc/perl.html>.

GETTING STARTED:

 To build and test this distribution, type:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make test

 Real tests exist within the F<tests> directory, and just happen to be examples
 of how to use different parts of POE.  Once everything looks good, it can be
 installed by typing:

   make install

-- Rocco Caputo / troc@netrus.net
