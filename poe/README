The bulk of this README's information has migrated to the POE manpage.

------------------------------
Compatibility Between Versions
------------------------------

As POE moves closer towards the Common Sense axis, it sometimes
diverges away from the Backwards Compatible axis.  If this version is
being installed over a previous one, please check the Changes file to
see what it might break.  Interface changes usually are documented.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE may be installed through the CPAN shell in the usual CPAN shell
manner.  It typically is:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install POE'

It involves a little more work if you have an older CPAN shell:

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  install POE

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE can also be installed manually.  The latest CPAN version can be
found at <ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or in
a similarl named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.  The most
recent development snapshot, which only rarely contains heinous
showstopper bugs, is available from the author's web site at
<http://www.newts.org/~troc/poe.html>.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as an exercise for
the reader.  To "build" and test it afterwards:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The POE manpage discusses system requirements and compatibility
issues.  You can preview it with:

  perldoc ./POE.pm

There are several sample programs in the samples subdirectory.  The
POE manpage briefly explains them.

  ls -l samples

Finally you can install it:

  make install

Test Results and Coverage
-------------------------

Test results for 0.1009 or a 486-50 with not much memory:

  t/00_coverage.......ok
  t/01_sessions.......ok
  t/02_alarms.........ok
  t/03_aliases........ok

  All tests successful.
  Files=14, Tests=170, 459 wallclock secs (224.73 cusr + 30.79 csys = 255.52 CPU)

POE's development after 0.1005 consists of a big push to test
everything.  To further this effort, the author wrote a test coverage
reporting program; then he discovered Devel::Coverage.  Oh well!
Anyway, here's the test coverage summary for version 0.1009:

  Source File                         =   Ran / Total = Covered
  POE.pm                              =    19 /    19 = 100.00%
  POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm         =    23 /    23 = 100.00%
  POE/Driver/SysRW.pm                 =    42 /    54 =  77.78%
  POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm                 =    11 /    85 =  12.94%
  POE/Filter/Line.pm                  =    15 /    20 =  75.00%
  POE/Filter/Reference.pm             =     4 /    66 =   6.06%
  POE/Filter/Stream.pm                =     2 /    11 =  18.18%
  POE/Kernel.pm                       =   694 /   926 =  74.95%
  POE/Preprocessor.pm                 =   119 /   138 =  86.23%
  POE/Session.pm                      =    81 /   194 =  41.75%
  POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm             =     5 /    65 =   7.69%
  POE/Wheel/ListenAccept.pm           =     5 /    43 =  11.63%
  POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm              =    99 /   183 =  54.10%
  POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm          =   194 /   275 =  70.55%
  All Told                            =  1313 /  2121 =  61.90%

Good luck, and thank you for reading!
