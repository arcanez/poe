* About

POE is the Perl Object Environment, a non-forking, non-blocking, co-operative
multitasking, object-oriented virtual environment.  When finished, it should
look almost exactly like a cross between a MUD and an operating system.

* Version 0.01 includes:

The POE Kernel.  This provides an event queue, select(2) logic, alarms (delayed
events) and limited signal processing.

A state machine class (Session) that reacts to state transitions (events)
created or dispatched from the Kernel.

Reusable boilerplace state machines (Wheels) that extend Sessions by adding
their states when constructed and removing their states when destroyed.

* New in version 0.02:

A tied hash that manages objects and attributes, called Curator.

* To Do:

Higher-level object management, such as referential integrity maintenance
between inverse (converse?) attributes: (contains/location, owner/owns;
parents/children); behavior (code attributes) execution; security (can the
currently running behavior read/write attributes, destroy this object, etc.?).

Input parsing, and side-effects of input that include invoking objects'
behaviors.

* To build, test and install this distribution, type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install

Please see the F<tests> directory for examples that exercise different parts
of POE.
