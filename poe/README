The bulk of this README's information has migrated to the POE manpage.

------------------------------
Compatibility Between Versions
------------------------------

As POE moves closer towards the Common Sense axis, it sometimes
diverges away from the Backwards Compatible axis.  If this version is
being installed over a previous one, please check the Changes file to
see what it might break.  Interface changes usually are documented.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE may be installed through the CPAN shell in the usual CPAN shell
manner.  It typically is:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install POE'

It involves a little more work if you have an older CPAN shell:

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  install POE

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE can also be installed manually.  The latest CPAN version can be
found at <ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or in
a similarl named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.  The most
recent development snapshot, which only rarely contains heinous
showstopper bugs, is available from the author's web site at
<http://www.newts.org/~troc/poe.html>.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as an exercise for
the reader.  To "build" and test it afterwards:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The POE manpage discusses system requirements and compatibility
issues.  You can preview it with:

  perldoc ./POE.pm

There are several sample programs in the samples subdirectory.  The
POE manpage briefly explains them.

  ls -l samples

Finally you can install it:

  make install

-------------------------
Test Results and Coverage
-------------------------

These are the `make test' results for POE 0.1104.  Hardware: Cyrix
P166+; 64MB RAM.  Software: OS/2 4, fix 13; perl 5.6.0; no Perl/Tk; no
Event.

  All tests successful, 3 tests skipped.
  Files=21, Tests=365, 190 wallclock secs ( 0.00 cusr +  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

These are the `make test' results for POE 0.1104.  Hardware: AMD
486-40 (overclocked to 50); 16MB RAM.  Software: FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE;
perl 5.6.0; Perl/Tk 800.021; Event 0.79.

  All tests successful.
  Files=21, Tests=381, 577 wallclock secs (297.42 cusr + 25.35 csys = 322.77 CPU)

These coverage results are for POE 0.1104 on the FreeBSD machine.
This machine more thoroughly tests different POE options, so the
coverage results are more meaningful.  Even at their best, however,
the results are highly misleading.  They are, in fact, slightly low
because of errors introduced by the profiling code.  Please take these
figures with a grain of salt.
